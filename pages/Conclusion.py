st.write('''To sum up, there is a relationship between GDP, literacy, and crime. Higher GDP is generally associated with higher literacy rates and lower crime rates, while lower GDP is often associated with lower literacy rates and higher crime rates.''')

st.write('''Higher GDP can lead to increased access to education and resources for learning, which can improve literacy rates and contribute to lower crime rates. In addition, economic prosperity can lead to increased job opportunities and overall improvements in living standards, which can also reduce criminal behavior.''')

st.write('''On the other hand, lower GDP may be accompanied by financial insecurity, a lack of economic opportunities, and other social and economic challenges, which can contribute to higher crime rates. Improving literacy rates can also be an effective way to reduce crime, as individuals who are literate are more likely to have higher levels of civic engagement and are less likely to engage in criminal behavior.''')

st.write('''It is important to note that the relationship between GDP, literacy, and crime is complex, and there are many other factors that can influence these variables. However, increasing GDP and literacy can be effective ways to reduce crime and improve public safety.''')
